download the data
run the data through resultParser/genericParser.js (or adapt one of the parsers to fit your needs
save the data off and create a suitable variable name for the data set.
add that dataset as an option to the HTML file in the split/ folder
edit the js and add a case for this new dataset. 
Run the python webserver and then verify that the dataset is good and can be plotted.
I think that is it.
