When a user hovers on a bar, color those with values < a different color so you can easily see who that person was beaten by in that category, possible give stat of persons rank. ie. rank: 34/107 and above or below average time by X sec; slower than fastest by X, faster than slowest by Y

Add filtering of data by gender, and stats on those faster, slower than you. 

highlight best event, worst event (not hard since only three) 
a 3-d plot of swim vs bike vs run paces/times to see if one is stronger than the other

stylize the swim time as waves, bike time as wheels, run time as sneakers

results as half moon or half moon to show progression and each leg is color coded diff : http://www.c4cycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BFC-infographic-1.jpg
