When a user hovers on a bar, color those with values < a different color so you can easily see who that person was beaten by in that category, possible give stat of persons rank. ie. rank: 34/107 and above or below average time by X sec; slower than fastest by X, faster than slowest by Y

Add filtering of data by gender, and stats on those faster, slower than you. 

highlight best event, worst event (not hard since only three) 
a 3-d plot of swim vs bike vs run paces/times to see if one is stronger than the other

stylize the swim time as waves, bike time as wheels, run time as sneakers

results as half moon or half moon to show progression and each leg is color coded diff : http://www.c4cycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BFC-infographic-1.jpg

Provide filtering functionality of the data set. ->on the change event, call the filter function on the desired field and then replot.
Allow switching of the dataset.
Allow user to select a user and then draw a vertical line dividing those faster/slower than that person.
Or color code those people differently.

Have some type of scroller that lets you see how you did compared to those who finished around the same time. A Focus+context paradigm. a scroller such that you see the results +2/-2 from you as a comparison.
